To connect to postgres using PHP.
*For Grpmates*

(1) Download XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html 
(2) Choose default settings to download. NOTE: Make sure "Apache" is clicked yes! 
	- Apache is a web server software used to run PHP codes.
(3) Install XAMPP in (C:)
(4) Go to C:\xampp\php\php.ini (OR php.config), uncomment the following lines:
		extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll
		extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll
		extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll
		
		*These allow PHP to make use these extension to connect to postgres!*
		
(5) Go to your postgres folder, search for "libpq.dll" --> I believe this is postgres's library/API for other software to integrate with postgres
(6) Copy the "libpq.dll" file, and paste it to: C:\xampp\php\ext. 
(7) Ensure that "libpq.dll" file exist in both the xampp and postgres folder!
(8) SETUP done.
(9) Note for php files, after you run XAMPP, you click "Start" button of Apache. This will start the apache server to run PHP codes.
(10) Verify that apache works by going to your browser, enter "localhost". This should bring you to the apache localhost homepage.
(11) For ALL php files to be edited, note that it should be placed in : C:\xampp\htdocs !
		Create your respective folder. 
			Eg: If you create a folder "cs2102proj", and you add your PHP file in it. EG: index.php
				To access this page, you type "localhost/cs2102proj/index.php
				
(12) To create a php file, just create a new file from your notepad++ or any other editor and save it as " .php"
(13) Sample code to test:
		
-------------------------------------------- START OF CODE -------------------------------------------------------		
		<?php
			$link = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres password=postgres");
			$query = " SELECT * FROM normaluser;";
			$res = pg_query($link,$query);
	
			echo "<table>";

			while ($row = pg_fetch_row($res)) {
			  echo "Name: $row[0]  Password: $row[1]   email: $row[2]    activation: $row[3]";
			  echo "<br />\n";
			}


		?>

		<html>
			<head> 
				<title> woohoo </title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<h1> testing. . . </h1>
			</body>			
		</html>
-------------------------------------------- END OF CODE -------------------------------------------------------		

	$link: -> pg_connect is a php method to connect to your postgres. Change your dbname, username and pw accordingly.
	$query : -> instantiate a variable called query, and assign the string value of "SELECT * FROM normaluser;" to it.
	$res : pg_query() takes in the $link (db connection) in the first Argument, and the $query (query) in the second Argument.
	*ignore <table> , it is a HTML syntax*
	
	pg_fetch_row($res) will fetch a single row and assign it to $row. therefore I run a loop to fetch every row till the end.
	$row is an array, size depending on the number of columns.
	
	
(14) Save this code in your index.php.
(15) Ensure it is saved in the correct folder.
(16) Go to ur browser and enter into the URL : "localhost/cs2102proj/index" 
(17) It should work
